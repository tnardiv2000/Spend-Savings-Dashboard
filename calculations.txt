# Spend & Savings Dashboard - Data Transformations

All calculations and adjustments are performed in Power Query on the sample datasets.

1. Data Type Adjustments
   - 'Date' columns converted to Date type
   - 'Spend', 'Savings', 'Target_Spend', 'Target_Savings' columns converted to Number type
   - 'Category' and 'Product' columns set to Text type

2. Column Adjustments
   - Renamed columns for clarity: 'Target_Spend' instead of 'Target'
   - Added 'KPI' column: Savings / Spend
   - Corrected formula inconsistencies when changing value types to percentage
   - Corrected minor inconsistencies in Category names (e.g., "Software" vs "software")

3. Aggregations / Grouping
   - No aggregations in Power Query for this sample dashboard (all aggregations handled in visuals)
   - Data ready for filtering by Geo, Country, Category, Product, and Date

4. Other Notes
   - Dataset is anonymized and simplified for portfolio use
   - No sensitive company data is included

# Dimension Tables and Aggregations

1. Dim_Date
   - Extracted Year, Month, Quarter, and Day columns from 'Date' in Actual_Spend
   - Ensures filtering and grouping in visuals by time periods

2. Dim_Product
   - Unique list of Category and Product from the Actual_Spend dataset
   - Used for filtering and grouping spend by Product and Category
   - Created CategoryProductKey to not have duplicates

3. Dim_Geo
   - Unique list of Geo and Country from the Actual_Spend dataset
   - Used for filtering and grouping spend by Geo and Country
   - Created GeoCountryKey to not have duplicates

4. Notes
   - No complex transformations applied; focus was on creating clean, reusable dimension tables
   - Supports filtering and drill-down in the dashboard
